					<h2>Motive</h2>
					<p>
						Refugees are an undervalued group of people that have to go through
						a lot. Their struggles don't end once they arrive in their new
						country.<br />
						<br />
						The average Dutch citizen does not nearly know the amount of
						problems refugees encounter here, in the Netherlands. This lack of
						understanding and empathy creates boundaries.

					<h2>Solution</h2>
					<p>
						<b>Informing</b> the target audience about the obstacles, creates
						ground for understanding, which could lead to a change of view.
						<br />
						<br />
						<b>Humanising</b> refugees, showing the target audience
						<i>they</i> are just like <i>us</i>, helps promote empathy.<br /><br />
						<b>Frustrating</b> the audience by trying to translate the refugees'
						obstacles into digital ones provokes emotion.<br /><br />
						<b>Call to Actions</b> can be used to reduce the loss of potential
						action, by ending the experience with potential ways to make a
						difference for refugees.

						his life in the Netherlands. Move your way towards goals like
						finding a job or a home. <br />
						<br />
						The player will encounter obstacles every step of the way; what
						seems to be a straightforward process, quickly spirals into a
						complex mess. <br />
						<br />
						Long waiting lists, incomprehensible documents and other
						complications show our crooked system. <br />
