					<h2>Project</h2>
					<p>
						This school team project was about solving a particul frustration
						you and your team have now everyone's mostly at home. We all had one
						frustration in common; dishes that are not in dishwashers and
						uncleaned kitchen equipment. <br /><br />
						So we came up with a product to help counter this. <br /><br />

					<h2>Research</h2>
					<p>
						To design a solution to this problem we had to know how first. So we
						setup a research plan to answer the following questions:
						<br /><br />
						What motivates people?<br />
						What possible ways are there to motivate each other to clean up?<br />
						How do you make chores fun to do? <br />
						How do you strengthen the feeling of satisfaction and pride of a
						person?

					<h2>Ideation</h2>
					<p>
						With the answers we got from our research we went off to come up
						with many different concepts. Most of the concepts revovled around
						competition, rewards and music.
						<br /><br />
						The idea we liked the most was D.I.N.G. a speaker friend to look
						after.

					<h2>Concept</h2>
					<p>
						DING is a tamagotchi like bluetooth speaker in the appearance of a
						noodle monster. It's noodles shine light so it can also be used as a
						night light. <br /><br />
						DING has it's own emotions, it will express happiness and play
						music. When it's fully content you'll be able to play music for 4
						hours. The less time remaining the more it's mood goes down. When
						angry, DING will not play music anymore and express frustration.
						<br /><br />
						To make DING happy again you need to charge up his happiness bar.
						You do so by cleaning up in the kitchen, where his docking station
						stands.
