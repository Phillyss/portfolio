					<h2>Project</h2>
					<p>
						A personal school project about something you're passionate about.
						Discord is a communication platform similar to Microsoft Teams.
						Users can develop their own bots to enhance the experience within
						their own servers.<br />
						<br />
						I like the Discord friends I've made and I thought making a bot to
						make our server better would be an amazing way to learn Javascript
						better.

					<h2>Concepting</h2>
					<p>
						Because just programming a bot wouldn't suffice for a complete
						project the concept has to be well founded. <br /><br />
						To give my project structure I used the Double Diamond. It consists
						of four stages: Discover, define, develop and deliver. <br /><br />
						After defining stakeholders, problems and suggestions of the end
						users I went to ideation. Using MoSCoW I chose the final features.

					<h2>Finished Product</h2>
					<p>
						The bot has several features, some are: an event announcement
						system, it adds and removes roles and a digital Treasure Hunt for
						people to solve.<br /><br />
						The bot also needed a profile. I ended up using the first logo as
						it's avatar. It corresponds with the server name's theme.
