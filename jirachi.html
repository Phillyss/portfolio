				<h2>Project</h2>
				<p>
					A small project that quickly grew way beyond I inteded becoming more of a passion. Developed for a
					Pokemon Showdown server.<br />
					<br />
					Challengers get to battle Gym Leaders,
					collect badges and become Champion. This Discord bot expands upon the gamification of the server and
					automizes a lot by
					tracking wins, currency, roles, etc.<br />
					<br />
					Written in NodeJS using MongoDB to store user data.

				<h2>Features</h2>
				<p>
					Matches won will be tracked through a database, which works as a leveling system increasing your
					role. Everything role related is automated or handled through simple commands.
					<br /> <br />
					Rewarded currency can be spent in a shop to help future battles, build up passive power ups or fun
					one-time-use-items all based around Pokemon.
					<br /><br />
					Useful commands like the image above are used to easily see what Gym Leaders are online and which
					types are available to battle increasing UX. <br /><br />
					Daily and weekly recurring events automate part of motivating members to stay active.

				<h2>Progress</h2>
				<p>
					This is still an ongoing project. I love coding and this is the project I just keep expanding and
					expanding upon because I keep coming up with more ideas to make the server more awesome.<br /><br />
					It's a project I've learned a lot from as it contains a lot of different code elements, game design
					and since it's mostly text based UX design has been a huge job.
