					<h2>Project</h2>
					<p>
						A small project that quickly grew way beyond my intention, becoming
						more of a passion project. Developed for a Pokemon Showdown
						server.<br />
						<br />
						Challengers get to battle Gym Leaders, collect badges and become
						Champion. This Discord bot expands upon the gamification of the
						server and automizes a lot by tracking wins, currency, roles,
						etc.<br />
						<br />
						Written in NodeJS using MongoDB to store user data.

					<h2>Features</h2>
					<p>
						Matches won will be tracked in a database, which works as a leveling
						system increasing your role. Everything role related is automated or
						handled through simple commands.
						<br />
						<br />
						Rewarded currency can be spent in a shop to help future battles,
						build up passive power ups or fun one-time-use-items all based
						around Pokemon.
						<br /><br />
						Useful commands like the image above are used to easily see what Gym
						Leaders are online and which types are available to battle,
						increasing UX. <br /><br />
						Daily and weekly recurring events automate part of motivating
						members to stay active.

					<h2>Progress</h2>
					<p>
						This is still an ongoing project. I love coding and this is the
						project I just keep expanding and expanding upon because I keep
						coming up with more ideas to make the server more interesting.<br /><br />
						It's a project I've learned a lot from, as it contains a lot of
						different code elements and game design. Because it's mostly text
						based, UX design has been a huge job.
